		    <h2>2018 BSc Computing Science and Psychology</h2>
		    <p>In the February 2018 I have started to visit university once more.<br><br>
			Computer Science<br>
			With great hunger for deep understanding of software development I puzzled 
			out ideal path to work with great range of programming languages such as 
			Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP within the university projects
			and also get deep understanding of the development process and security.
			On the side I have been self educating deeper into the programming 
			possibilities and practices, including libraries, framework and related 
			languages such as C++.<br><br>
			Psychology<br>
			Psychology has been my hobby since secondary school I have taken some
			modules for that allow me deeper understand human mind and how we think.
			I would like to use this knowledge in developing software, To make more
			user friendly user interfaces and adapt features to unskilled users.</p>
